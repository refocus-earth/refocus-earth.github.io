        <p>Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decreases in pulp demand and production (high energy industry) would have social impacts, such as industry side effects</li>
          <li>Scientists shouldn't decide what a "fair" carbon budget is and instead ask countering questions and connect everyone involved or affected by decisions</li>
          <li>There are diverging opinions if a shift to "sustainable" technologies is enough or not</li>
          <li>Deliberative democracy can be a methodology to include diverse opinions into decision-making processes and enable more fair transformations</li>

        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p>In the first session of this seminar series Thomas Hahn and Mikael Karlsson introduced FairTrans, a new research program designed to promote transformations to a fair and fossil free future in Sweden. FairTrans is a collaboration of academic research with trade unions, large Swedish popular movements and civil society organizations. The program aims to design roadmaps for Sweden to stay within the remaining carbon budget of the Paris Agreement.</p>
        <p>Thomas and Mikael elaborated on the planned approaches and expected challenges of the research. Regarding forests, the discussion brought to light tensions inherent to the social costs and impacts of decreasing pulp-production to achieve emission reduction goals – a high energy industry. A key challenge of the program – which is also a strength of the research team – will be to understand and align the social and environmental choices rather than trading them off each other. The program leaders also emphasized that FairTrans researchers will not be deciding what a “fair” carbon budget should be. Instead their role is to ask critical questions and bring a whole-systems perspective that connects those involved or affected by decisions. This discussion point brings to the fore a clear distinction and perhaps complementarity between FairTrans and REFoCUs projects: FairTrans engages stakeholders in the forest sector and industry, whereas the deliberative democracy approach of REFoCUs aims to engage a random and representative sample of the population at large to discuss the choices and trade-offs inherent to transformations. Deliberative democracy can be an approach to enable fairer transformations by including the deliberation of diverse opinions into decision-making processes – the bridge to action would also be facilitated by a stakeholder-based approach, but are these always compatible?</p>
        <p>The discussion also addressed the multiple facets necessary for transformations: single solutions, such as shifts to sustainable technologies are necessary but insufficient. Also necessary in an energy transition are improved processes that rely on less energy and that reduce waste –  by re-using it to produce energy for example. Importantly, behaviour changes and reduced consumption are also necessary for a fossil-free future.</p>

        <p>Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sweden is fairly conservative in regards to participatory forms of governance</li>
          <li>Power in Sweden is decentralized geographically, but at local levels citizens have limited power compared to local government</li>
          <li>Swedish democracy is built on a close link between social movements and political parties, but this has declined steadily over recent decades</li>
          <li>Three democracy inquiries have recommended more participatory democracy resulting in different forms of citizen dialogue at local levels, usually open meetings</li>
          <li>Experiences of participation have been mixed. Processes were not representative, and sometimes their outcomes were ignored in decisions, leading to distrust of government</li>
          <li>Deliberation can be successful if there is a formal process with clear rules and objectives, an inclusion of all voices, and a public communication of the results</li>
          <li>The association of municipalities and regions (SKR) is keen on deliberative democracy, but politicians, particularly from larger parties are skeptical</li>
          <li>Deliberative mini-publics have a different dynamic, have not been tried, and may offer a tool to address harsh conflicts about local planning in municipalities that are open to these approaches</li>

        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p>In the third seminar of the REFoCUs seminar series, Daniel Lindvall shared his insights on the nature and recent evolution of democracy in Sweden, and the possibilities for experiments with deliberative democracy. Daniel traced the recent history of participatory democracy and three democracy inquiries, one of which he led in 2014. In general Sweden is fairly conservative with regards to democratic innovations for a number of reasons and the perception that there is not much distance between elected representatives and citizens. Another point that Daniel shared is that power in Sweden is very centralized with local government politicians having the most and citizens having the lowest power. Following recommendations particularly from the democracy inquiry in 2000, participatory experiments were initiated in local planning questions. These were not very successful in general because open dialogues attracted a self selecting group which exacerbated political inequality. Another reason is that many decisions were already taken before the citizen dialogue, which led to distrust among citizens. Daniel outlined guidelines from his recent democracy inquiry that participatory democracy initiatives need to have a formal process with clear rules, all voices need to be heard, the objectives need to be clear, and results need to be shared and communicated after the deliberation.</p>
        <p>The discussion brought up that on a local level there are very harsh conflicts around e.g. school closures, wind farms etc and no tools are currently being used to bring in a full range of views and resolve these harsh conflicts. Municipalities struggling with these conflicts are more open to democratic innovations and experimentation with mini-publics on a local level could provide some answers to these challenges. Another point that came up in the discussion is that the context and focus of conflicts and decision-making varies between the national and the local level. On a local level there are more concrete and practical discussions by concerned people, whereas on a national level debates are more general and theoretical, and ideology plays a larger role.</p>

        <p>Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deliberative mini-publics enable more political equality and inclusivity, create a more informed public opinion, promote democratic citizenship, and bridge ethnic, religious or ideological divides</li>
          <li>Currently deliberative democracy has a low impact on decision-making and policy-making</li>
          <li>Expert opinions can be more polarized than the public opinion</li>
          <li>Politicians in Finland seem to have become more enthusiastic about deliberative mini-publics as they are more informed about and experienced with them</li>
          <li>Not being clear about the goals can produce mistrust and prevent the further development of deliberation for democratic decision-making</li>

        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p>Marina Lindell shared her experience with deliberative mini-publics (DMPs), their role in democracy, and her experiences from experiments in Finland. Marina described the core elements of DMPs: They start with a random selection of citizens, then pass to a learning phase with experts sharing their expertise, and then move over to the actual deliberation and a decision-making phase. DMPs enable more political equality and inclusivity, create a more informed public opinion, promote democratic citizenship, and bridge ethnic, religious or ideological divides. It is also suited to deal with long-term issues through the deliberation of futures. A general criticism of DMPs is that they currently have had limited impact on decision-making and policy-making. </p>
        <p>Following Marina's presentation, the discussion brought up that experts' opinions (for example in the forestry debate) are more polarized than public opinions. One idea to deal with this is to make clear what a scientist's expertise is and try to prevent the mix of private opinions with professional expertise. In some mini-publics, experts are restricted to answering questions from the participants (rather than giving their own opinion). The importance of a neutral convenor was seen as essential for legitimacy - in Finland this has largely been universities. Another question that came up is which kind of politicians are generally open to more innovative forms of democracy, which brought up the observation that left-wing politicians are generally speaking more open, and right-wing politicians more hesitant - even though DMPs could be argued to respond to populist rhetoric to give people more say over bureaucracies. The media - sometimes sensationalist - has an important role to play in the success of DMPs, but too often the media doesn’t answer this role: bringing in the media early on in the process can help. Marina also reflected that in Finland experiments with DMPs have gained ground through University-led initiatives and research funding. Then politicians have become more open to DMPs as they have become more experienced and informed. Furthermore the point was raised that participants need to know what the goals and expected outcomes are. Not being clear about this can produce mistrust because implicit expectations are not fulfilled, which can then prevent the further development of deliberation for democratic decision-making.</p>

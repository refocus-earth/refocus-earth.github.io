        <p>Highlights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is a public opinion that goes towards "natural" approaches for carbon dioxide removal, especially trees are seen as "the" solution</li>
          <li>Neither in the public discourse nor by climate experts the bigger picture for carbon dioxide removal is seen. This suggests a role for other approaches like deliberative democracy to produce such a overarching systems perspective</li>
          <li>There are diverging opinions if a shift to "sustainable" technologies is enough or not</li>
          <li>Emission strategies are mostly written by governments which impacts the language and the consequential perspective in such papers</li>

        <p>Summary:</p>
        <p>In REFoCUs seminar 2 Naghmeh Nasiritousi and Alexandra Buylova explored the role of forest-based carbon dioxide removal in countries’ climate strategies. They shared their insights on how forest and land-based approaches to achieving climate targets are represented in national long-term low emission development strategies based on their recent paper. In particular, they engaged with the highlighted types of forest solutions, the perceptions of their saliency in climate action, and the barriers and opportunities to their implementation. Moreover they also showed a comparison of the insights across countries.</p>
        <p>Following the presentation, the discussion brought up that there is a public opinion that goes towards "natural" approaches for carbon dioxide removal. There is especially a hype about trees as "the" solution, as its implementation is perceived as easier than other approaches.
The discussion also raised the challenge that neither in the public discourse nor by climate experts is the bigger picture of carbon dioxide removal. In the context of the REFoCUs project, this could be a point from which deliberative democracy approaches could be applied to create the missing overarching systems perspective. In regard to this, the example of the French emission development strategy came up, because this strategy was submitted twice, with the second submission after France's citizen assembly. Between the second and the first submission differences emerged, especially in approaches related to lifestyle. Criticism that came up relates to the fact that countries act quite separately from each other and focus on different solutions that will not be available on a large scale. Such observation reinforces the need for engaging with the bigger picture to achieve climate targets on a global level.</p>
        <p>Furthermore the strategies are mostly written by governments, which impacts the language used in the papers. As a consequence such strategies represent a government's perspective on the world and are not necessarily as inclusive as such papers could be in regard to the existing diversity of perceptions, values, and assumptions.</p>
